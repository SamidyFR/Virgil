    <h3>"What's Virgil?"</h3>
    <p>
      Virgil is a pirated software search engine made to help out with beginners
      and save time instead of checking multiple sites.
    </p>

    <h3>
      "ehh. The few loved software sites are so good that I'm not sure a search
      engine is really needed."
    </h3>
    <p>
      i can give you a few reasons: <br />
      1. Helps out with beginners in pirating. <br />
      2. Some sites might have the software, but lock it behind a bad file
      hoster. making you check other sites. <br />
      3. Some sites might have the software, but its an old update. <br />
      4. Some sites just dont have the software you want, its a pretty common
      thing, even with the big ones. <br />
    </p>

    <h3>"are you sure these sources are safe?"</h3>
    <p>
      uh.. yeah? Look, heres the deal:
      <strong
        >you can NEVER be 100% sure a site is safe. they may turn malicious one
        day and start putting malware.</strong
      >
      <br />
      Which is why we always inform users to be cautious when downloading
      pirated software. <br />
      but with that said, all of the sites indexed are from
      <a href="https://fmhy.net">fmhy</a>, which is regularly updated to catch
      issues like this. <br />
      If a site ever turns malicious or a site gets added, we update our search
      engine ASAP.
