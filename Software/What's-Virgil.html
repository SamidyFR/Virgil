<h3>"What's Virgil?"</h3>
<a class="a_animation">Virgil is a pirated software search engine made to help out with beginners and save time instead of checking multiple sites.</a>

<h3>"ehh. The few loved software sites are so good that I'm not sure a search engine is really needed."</h3>
<a class="a_animation">i can give you a few reasons: <br>
   1. Helps out with beginners in pirating. <br>
   2. Some sites might have the software, but lock it behind a bad file hoster. making you check other sites. <br>
   3. Some sites might have the software, but its an old version. <br>
   4. Some sites just dont have the software you want, its a pretty common thing, even with the big ones. <br>

</a>


<h3>"are you sure these sources are safe?"</h3>
<a class="a_animation">uh.. yeah? Look, heres the deal: <strong>you can NEVER be 100% sure a site is safe. they may turn malicious one day and start putting malware.</strong> <br>
    Which is why we always inform users to be cautious when downloading pirated software. <br>
    but with that said, all of the sites indexed are from https://fmhy.net, which is regularly updated to catch issues like this. <br>
    If a site ever turns malicious or a site gets added, we update our search engine ASAP.
